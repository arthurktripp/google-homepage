The Odin Project; recreating the Google homepage in HTML &amp; CSS.

Beginning project on May 17, 2020. I will attempt to recreate the Google homepage's layout from scratch, merely by HTML & CSS. The recent TOP section had me spending a lot of time on the FreeCodeCamp website, where I completed the 5 optional projects -- a couple of those were more complex designwise, but here the focus will be on making something look exactly as it's supposed to.

Took a few hours to do, mostly tweaking. Figuring out how to center the search bar beneath the logo was a challenge, but I spent the biggest chunk of time making individual elements feel like the original (hover attributes like drop shadows, for example).

Before I started, I drew a wirefram sketch that really helped me conceptualize the entire page. My divs were actually very, very close to the finalized version.
